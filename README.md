# Art Trivia Game
## A game where you are shown a picture of a work of art from the Art Institute of Chicago collection and you have to guess the artist.
This game will be accessing the Art Institute of Chicago's API. It is going to display random images of the artwork from the API and people playing the game will have multiple choice options of artist names to choose from. For every correct answer, the player will get a point. After the correct answer is revealed, other information about the work of art such as country of origin, year created, artistic medium, descriptions/background info, etc will be displayed for the player to learn more about the work of art. At the end of the game, the player will receive a percentage of how many questions they got right.
